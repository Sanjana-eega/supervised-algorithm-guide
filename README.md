In supervised types:
regression(we have matrices evaluation we use rmse,mse,mae,r^2)=>linear regressison,decision tree, random forest regression,knnr,svmr
classification=> logistic regression,rfc(accuracy, precision,f1score,recall),dtc,knnc,svm classifier

When we are applying nlp algorithm this matters: (latm,rrna,rna)

TRYING OUT ALL THE ALGORITHM AND ITS ACCURACY FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING
